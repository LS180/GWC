  <h2>Short Bio:</h2>
    <p>Hi. :-) I was born in San Jose and have been living in Gilroy since 2007. I went to Canoas, El Roble, Brownell, & G. E. C. A. I won 
   	   second place in a bridge competition in my freshman year and second place in Daze of Code in my sophomore year. I am looking forward
       to winning second place again, if not first or third place in this upcoming competition for my junior year.</p>
